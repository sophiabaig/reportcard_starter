#### MY NOTES
- DOM is essentially a representation of the HTML, and we basically need to save references to HTML elements in our script.js file in order to have access and manipulate the HTML elements
  - We use document.querySelector but there are other ways to do so
  - Use '#' to select by id and '.' to select by class
- Use the innerHTML property to update the contents of an HTML element
- Template literals: ${expression} to indicate an expression/variable in a string
- Event listeners are used when something happens on the user side that needs to affect the code
